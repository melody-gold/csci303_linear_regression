# CSCI303: Data Science - Linear Regression

#### *Melody Goldanloo*

## Overview
The project applies Linear Regression to analyze and predict bike rentals using the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and advanced techniques like polynomial regression and hyperparameter tuning to improve predictions.

## Key Features
- ### Data Preprocessing:
    - Standardized features and encoded categorical variables.
    - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
- ### Model Development:
    - Built and evaluated linear regression models.
    - Explored polynomial regression and hyperparameter tuning.
 - ### Evaluation Metrics:
     - Assessed performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
     - Visualized residuals and predictions for deeper insights.

## Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python

### Libraries
- `pandas` - Data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- `numpy` - Mathematical operations and handling arrays.
- `scikit-learn` - Model building and evaluation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - Data visualization.

## Dataset
- **Name:** UCI Bike Sharing Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
- **Description:**
    - Daily records of bike rentals.
    - Features like weather, seasons, and holidays.
